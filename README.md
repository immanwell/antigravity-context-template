# 🚀 Antigravity Context Engineering Template

This repository provides a structured "Memory Bank" for autonomous agents in Google Antigravity, implementing best practices from Context Engineering.

**Structure:**
* `memory-bank/`: Persistent context files (Project Brief, Current State, Patterns).
* `.agent/rules/`: Antigravity files that auto-load to enforce context rules.
* `.agent/workflows/`: Saved sequences for common tasks (load context, planning).

**Usage:**
1.  Fork this repository or copy the `memory-bank/` and `.agent/` folders into your project root.
2.  Fill in the template files in `memory-bank/` with your project details.
3.  In Antigravity, use the slash commands (e.g., `/load-context`) to orchestrate your agent.
